# Forbidden Statistics
Forbidden was originally created in April 2017. The original bot was designed to be a multi-purpose bot. After many years it was getting more and more difficult to maintain due to the large amount of features that were available. This year in 2020 we decided to scale back the bot and focus on a single category. We chose Game Statistics. While, for the time being the bot will remain with showing Game Statistics we made decide to branch out to other Social Media Statisitcs, etc.

## Frequently asked questions

### How do I link one of the games to my account?
This is achieved by using the "gamelink" command. This command allows you to link accounts to your names.\
To link an account just type "gamelink [game] [options]" for example "gamelink overwatch pc Duck#12641".\
You can find the options for your game by typing "gamelink help"\

### How do I find my SteamID?
If you have the URL to your user profile or the vanity username of your account, you can lookup your SteamID with the command "steamlookup". This command only displays your Profile Avatar, Profile Username and your SteamID.\
To use this command just type "steamlookup [CommunityURL | Vanity Username]". For example "steamlookup forbiddenduck".\

### Why does the bot say my profile is private when I just changed it to public
Depending on the game you are trying to view, it make take a few minutes for the bot to notice the changed. We can not fix this as this is to do with how the game provides your statistics to us.
Please keep in mind that it takes 10 minutes for the bot to update statistics.
